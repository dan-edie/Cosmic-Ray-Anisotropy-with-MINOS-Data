# muon-astronomy

This contains my graduate thesis project code. I was responsible for using CERN ROOT's file system to pull data collected from the Main Injector Neutrino Oscillation Search,
or MINOS, Far Detector that was located in the Soudan Iron Mine in northern Minnesota. 

The project was my first major coding project, and there are definitely errors I made that I would remedy given the chance. As is, the code does work, though the results showed
a gaussian curve slightly off-center, possibly an error with my binning.
